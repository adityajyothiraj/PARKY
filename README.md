# PARKY
PARKY is an innovative parking management system that allows users to book parking slots through a dedicated mobile app. The system ensures seamless entry and exit by using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and OpenCV to scan vehicle registration numbers.
Booking: Users enter their vehicle’s registration number and name via the mobile app, which is then saved to a Firebase database.
Entry & Exit Gates: At the gates, cameras scan the vehicle’s registration number, compare it with the database, and automatically open the gate if the numbers match.
Database Management: After the vehicle exits, the registration number is removed from the database, ensuring efficient and secure space management.
Technologies used: Firebase, OpenCV, OCR, Mobile App (Frontend).
